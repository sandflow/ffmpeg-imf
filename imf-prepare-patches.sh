git notes add -m "The IMF demuxer accepts as input an IMF CPL. The assets referenced by the CPL can be
contained in multiple deliveries, each defined by an ASSETMAP file:

ffmpeg -assetmaps <path of ASSETMAP1>,<path of ASSETMAP>,... -i <path of CPL>

If -assetmaps is not specified, FFMPEG looks for a file called ASSETMAP.xml in the same directory as the CPL.

EXAMPLE:
    ffmpeg -i http://ffmpeg-imf-samples-public.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/countdown/CPL_f5095caa-f204-4e1c-8a84-7af48c7ae16b.xml out.mp4

The Interoperable Master Format (IMF) is a file-based media format for the
delivery and storage of professional audio-visual masters.
An IMF Composition consists of an XML playlist (the Composition Playlist)
and a collection of MXF files (the Track Files). The Composition Playlist (CPL)
assembles the Track Files onto a timeline, which consists of multiple tracks.
The location of the Track Files referenced by the Composition Playlist is stored
in one or more XML documents called Asset Maps. More details at https://www.imfug.com/explainer.
The IMF standard was first introduced in 2013 and is managed by the SMPTE.

CHANGE NOTES:

- add imf_probe
- improve imf-specific function names
